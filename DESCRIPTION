Description: Put scale ticks on all four sides on a ggplot by copying axes from bottom to top and left to right. Think of this as a replacement for the panel grid, not a way of adding multiple scales to the same plot. Note that this function converts the plot from a ggplot object to a gtable, so build the whole plot first and then call mirror-ticks as the last transformation before plotting.
